I am a first year PhD student in Biostatistics, University of Washington. I am working with Dr. Robyn McClelland as a research assistant at the Collaborative Health Studies Coordinating Center.

Prior to coming to UW,  I obtained my master degree from the Peking University. I hold bachelor degrees in medicine and economics from Peking University. I am interested in causal inference, and its applications in public health and social science.

I am originally from a small town Anhui province, Eastern China. When not working, I enjoy playing tennis, watching movies (especially art movies) and spending time with friends.
